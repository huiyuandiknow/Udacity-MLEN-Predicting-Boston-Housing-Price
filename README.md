### <a name="project-overview"></a>Project Overview

This is the project on Model Evaluation & Validation. The goal of this project is to construct a working model which has the capability of predicting the value of houses. The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Census+Income). This project involves with: 
- Calculate Statistics
- Define a performance metric
- Shuffle and Split data
- Fitting a model

### <a name="install"></a>Install

The project requires **Python 2.7** and the following Python libraries:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](pandas.pydata.org/)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

[Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/) is necessary for running the .ipynb files to run the code for the project. 

### <a name="code"></a>Code

All of the code is provided in the Jupyter notebook `boston_housing.ipynb`.
